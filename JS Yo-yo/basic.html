        <h2>Yomega Yo Yo With a Brain:</h2><br>
        <p>The Yomega Brain contains a centrifugal clutch that opens on the down swing, enabling the yo-yo to "sleep" or spin at the end of the string. When the yoyo slows down, the clutch snaps shut causing the yoyo to return automatically to the player's hand. The Yomega Brain is one of the most popular yoyo designs in history and great for beginners.</p>

        <h2>Yomega Power Brain XP:</h2><br>
        <p>The Yomega Power Brain is two high performance yoyos in one! Designed for both beginner and intermediate play, this yoyo uses a "Smart Switch" to enable the player to chose between automatic and manual function with the flick of a switch.  Beginners can easily get a sense of accomplishment while they learn to handle the yoyo in the automatic return mode. As their skills increase, they can switch to manual mode for longer, faster spin times and tricks that are more challenging.</p>
